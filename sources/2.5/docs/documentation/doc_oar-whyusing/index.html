<h1 id="whyusingoar">Why using OAR</h1>

<h2 id="oaradvantages">OAR advantages</h2>

<p>We present below some points that explain benefits of the new
version of OAR.</p>

<h3 id="abetterresourcemanagement">A better resource management</h3>

<p>Using Linux kernel new feature called cpuset, OAR2 allows a more
reliable management of the resources:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>No unattended processes should remain from previous jobs.</li>
  <li>Access to the resources is now restricted to the owner of the
  resources.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Beside, features like job dependency and check-pointing are now
available, allowing a better resources use.</p>

<p>A cpuset is attached to every process, and allows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>to specify which resource processor/memory can be used by a
  process, e.g. resources allocated to the job in OAR 2 context.</li>
  <li>to group and identify processes that share the same cpuset,
  e.g. the processes of a job in OAR 2 context, so that actions like
  clean-up can be efficiently performed. (here, cpusets provide a
  replacement for the group/session of processes concept that is not
  efficient in Linux).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="multi-cluster">Multi-cluster</h3>

<p>OAR 2 can manage complex hierarchies of resources. For example:
  ~ 1.  clusters
    2.  switchs
    3.  nodes
    4.  cpus
    5.  cores</p>

<h3 id="amodernclustermanagementsystem">A modern cluster management system</h3>

<p>By providing a mechanism to isolate the jobs at the core level, OAR
2 is one of the most modern cluster management systems. Users
developing cluster or grid algorithms and programs will then work
in a today's up-to-date environment similar to the ones they will
meet with other recent cluster management systems on production
platforms for instance.</p>

<h3 id="optimizationoftheresourcesusage">Optimization of the resources usage</h3>

<p>Now a day, machines with more than 4 cores become common. Thus, it
is then very important to be able to handle cores efficiently. By
providing resources selection and processes isolation at the core
level, OAR 2 allows users running experiments that do not require
the exclusivity of a node (at least during a preparation phase) to
have access to many nodes on one core only, but leave the remaining
cores free for other users. This can allow to optimize the number
of available resources.</p>

<p>Beside, OAR 2 also provide a time-sharing feature which will allow
to share a same set of resources among users.</p>

<h3 id="easieraccesstotheresources">Easier access to the resources</h3>

<p>Using OAR 2 OARSH connector to access the job resources, basic
usages will not anymore require the user to configure his SSH
environment as everything is handled internally (known host keys
management, etc). Beside, users that would actually prefer not
using OARSH can still use SSH with just the cost of some options to
set (one of the features of the OARSH wrapper is to actually hide
these options).</p>

<h3 id="gridresourcesinterconnection">Grid resources interconnection</h3>

<p>As access to one cluster resources is restricted to an attached
job, one may wonder if connections from job to job, from cluster to
cluster, from site to site would still be possible. OAR 2 provides
a mechanism called job-key than allows inter job communication,
even on several sites managed by several OAR 2 servers (this
mechanism is indeed used by OARGrid2 for instance).</p>

<h3 id="managementofabstractresources">Management of abstract resources</h3>

<p>OAR 2 features a mechanism to manage resources like software
licenses or other non-material resources the same way it manages
classical resources.</p>

<h2 id="oarusesandusers">OAR Uses and Users</h2>

<p>At the present time, OAR is used in several countries (France,
Slovakia, Brazil) by several types of users. These users are not
only programmers and computer specialists but also simple
scientists, novices at programming. Thus the spread of users type
is wide.</p>

<p>They are mainly:</p>

<ul>
<li>physicists</li>
<li>biologists that work on medical imaging, radioactivity study...</li>
<li>weathermen</li>
<li>chemical engineers</li>
<li>computer sciences engineers and researchers that work on many
subjects as cryptography, data mining, HPC...</li>
<li>stargazers that work on subjetcs like trajectory computation
and data analysis from probes</li>
</ul>
