==Presentation==

OAR is an opensource Resource and Job Management System (RJMS) also called batch scheduler which provides a simple and flexible exploitation of a cluster.

It manages resources of clusters as a traditional batch scheduler (as PBS / Torque / LSF / SGE).

In other words, it doesn't execute your job on the resources but manages them (reservation, acces granting) 
in order to allow you to connect these resources and use them.

For more information, please take a look at [http://oar.imag.fr our website].

You can download an [[Live | OAR Live CD]] to try OAR without installing it.
